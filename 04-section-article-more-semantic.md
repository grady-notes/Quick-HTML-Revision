# Section, Article, Header, Footer (Semantic HTML)

## Section Tag

This tag defines a section in an HTML document. It usually represents a generic section of a document, i.e, a thematic grouping of content typically with a heading.
For example a section tag can be used to depict chapters in a book, tabs in a tabular interface, etc.

## Article Tag

Article represents a self contained composition in a document. An article is a piece of content that should make a sense on its own or in other words, its meaning should not depend on some other tag.
Article is similar to the section tag & should have a heading of its own related to the content inside the article tag. It is geared more towards grouping things. An article is for a unit of content.
For example an article tag can be used to depict a blog post or a story, etc.

## Header Tag

A header tag is just to reserve a ehading area to the sectioning elements if the heading contains more than just one title such as images, graphics or any other content.

## Footer Tag

Footer tag is very similar to the header tag in terms of usage & visual representation. This tag includes additional information about the containing element.
For example a if the contaning element is an article then the footer tag can be used as to display the name of the author, or if the containing element is a displayed as a comment then the footer tag can be used to display the date & time of the comment, or it can be used to display a copyright notice with the Â© symbol along with the notice.

<b>ALL THE ABOVE MENTIONED TAGS DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIAL VISUAL REPRESENTATION IN THE BROWSER. THEY ARE JUST USED TO ADD MORE SEMANTIC OR MEANING TO THE HTML DOCUMENT & MAKE THE DOCUMENT MORE CLEAR SO THAT THE BROWSER UNDERSTANDS ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS PROPERLY.</b>
