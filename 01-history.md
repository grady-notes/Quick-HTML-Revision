# What is HTML ?

HTML is an acronym that stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

Markup Language is a language that is made up of tags or symbols that annotate that text to a document and carries specific meaning. A document being this way is still a textual document so it can be opened and rendered in a text editor but its purpose is to be processed by the browser that is capable of giving it an appropriate visual representation.

The HTML is essentially capable of adding more semantic or meaningful structure to a text and even connect to other documents by making it a hypertext. It is just a markup language that is used to build web pages or text documents that get rendered by the browser through an internet connection.

HTMTL forms the backbone of the contents and the fundamental building blocks of the webpages
